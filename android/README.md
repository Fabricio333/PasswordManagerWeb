# Android Wrapper for PasswordManagerWeb

This is a minimal Android project that loads the existing web application in a `WebView` after authenticating the user using the device's fingerprint (BiometricPrompt API). The private key can be stored encrypted and unlocked only after successful biometric authentication.

## Building

Use Android Studio to open the `android` directory and build the project.
