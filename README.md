# Password Manager
## Overview
This Password Manager is a web application designed to securely generate and manage passwords using mnemonic phrases and QR code scanning. It leverages cryptographic functions to ensure strong password generation and provides a user-friendly interface for managing site-specific passwords.

## Features
Mnemonic Phrase Generation and Validation: Generate and validate BIP-39 mnemonic phrases to ensure secure password derivation.
QR Code Scanning: Use the QR code scanner to input entropy for password generation.
Secure Password Generation: Generate strong, site-specific passwords using a combination of mnemonic phrases, user credentials, and site information.
Nonce Management: Automatically manage nonces for each site to ensure unique password generation.
Local Storage: Save nonces and settings locally for persistence across sessions.
Clipboard Copying: Easily copy generated passwords and settings to the clipboard for quick access.
Settings Export/Import: Export and import settings to backup or restore your configuration.
Reset Functions: Reset nonces and settings to start fresh if needed.
How to Use
Setup:
Ensure your browser supports the necessary cryptographic APIs.
Open the application in a web browser.
Generating a Mnemonic:
Use the "Generate Mnemonic" feature to create a new BIP-39 seed phrase.
Validate the mnemonic using the provided wordlist.
QR Code Scanning:
Use the QR code scanner to input entropy for your password generation.
Password Generation:
Enter the site name, user credentials, and mnemonic phrase.
Click "Show Password" to generate a password for the specified site.
Use "New Password" to increment the nonce and generate a new password.
Managing Nonces:
Nonces are automatically managed and stored in local storage.
Use "Reset Nonces" to clear all stored nonces.
Settings Management:
Export settings to backup your configuration.
Import settings to restore from a backup.
Copying to Clipboard:
Use the "Copy" feature to copy passwords and settings to the clipboard.
